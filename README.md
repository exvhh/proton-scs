Proton - SCS (Shared Cache System)

u know how you press play on your game and proton takes years to load up vulkan shaders and how each set of shaders takes up whole gigabytes of storage. Well, look no further, this is a Shared Cache System that substitutes similar shaders from different games you have downloaded saving time and space.
